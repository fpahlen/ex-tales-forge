defmodule TalesForge.Game.JevIntent do
  @moduledoc """
  The player-intent read as **one** TypeSafe Jev call.

  Jev never writes free text: every field is a choice over labels that this
  module proposes, and the numbers (durations, coin amounts, prices) are parsed
  from the player's text in Elixir, not by the model. See
  `docs/design-jev-intent.md`.

  The call answers six fields in one round-trip:

    * `action` — the primary action type (`t:TalesForge.Game.Schemas.action_type/0`);
    * `target` — which proposed candidate the action is aimed at (`candidates/1`),
      or `:none`;
    * `skill` — the check the action would roll, or `:none`;
    * `later` — a second action deferred to a later turn ("…at first light"),
      or `:none`;
    * `later_target` — the candidate that deferred action is aimed at, or `:none`;
    * `safety` — `benign`, `jailbreak`, `prompt_injection` or `nefarious`.

  Targets are index labels (`:c0`..`:c47`) over the candidate list so that no
  atoms are built from model output; `decode/3` maps the chosen index back to the
  candidate. `state/2` is a deterministic map (JSON encodes map keys sorted), so
  the same scene and text always serialise byte-identically.

  Live turns call it through `TalesForge.IntentJev` when the session's
  `INTENT_JEV` mode is `:shadow` or `:on` (`:off` never calls it). `mix
  intent.eval` measures the same request against the labelled fixture.
  """
